# Azul base app

This repo contains the Helm Charts for Azul.

## Validation

[json schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference) validates the `values.yaml` entries.
Azul helm charts use the [draft-07](https://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema)
schema version.

This is the latest release that Helm supports (see[here](https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/11340)
and [here](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/10732)) and vscode knows how to parse.

## ./azul

The main Helm Chart for Azul.
Ensure you read and understand the contents of `values.yaml`.

You'll need to create your own `values.yaml` with content relevant to your specific deployment environment.

### Redis

Redis is integrated into the Azul chart as its very unlikely you'll ever want to run redis elsewhere.

Redis can be updated by updating the image in the images list.

## ./infra

The Helm chart to deploy optional infrastructure related components of Azul is located in `infra`.
This allows installation of services that Azul relies on such as Opensearch and Minio.

In production it is recommended that large components such as Opensearch, Kafka and Minio
be installed outside the K8s cluster on dedicated hardware or an equivalent managed service by a provider is used.

Currently this includes:

- Opensearch
- OpenSearch Operator (optional Helm dependency)
- Minio
- Redis
- Keycloak
- Kafka
- Strimzi Kafka Operator (optional Helm dependency)

Data safety is not currently guaranteed between different versions of the `infra` chart.
PVCs may be deleted during an upgrade.
Please ensure all required data is backed up via the Azul disaster recovery module or otherwise.
DO NOT back data up to the Minio cluster provisioned by this chart.

## Disaster Recovery

The recovery service backs up Azul binary events and streams to S3.
This requires an external s3-compatible service, ideally running outside of the Azul infrastructure.

Backup and restore can be configured in the main `azul/values.yaml` file, disabled by default.

Please see Azul documentation for further information on configuring a backup and performing a restore.
Also reference `.recovery` in `values.yaml` for specific values that can be configured.

### Backup

Backup runs like a plugin taking in all kafka events and then downloading all their binary streams, it then saves this data to an S3 server. This is a continuous backup of current state and will never 'finish'.
Note - avoid deleting this pod as deletions will cause data not to be backed up.

## Purging and Backup

When files are purged from the system they are not purged from backup.

To purge a file from backup you need to create a new backup and then delete the existing backup.

This can be done using the `nextBackupLabel` parameter in the helm `values.yaml`.
It allows you to start a new backup before you stop the existing one.

Once monitoring indicates that the new backup has caught up to live you can then increment the backup label to match the nextBackupLabel.

Then only one backup will exist and the old backup should be removed with your organisations associated backup processes.

### Restore

Runs as a k8s 'job'. It will restore all raw stream data first and then restore all the kafka events.

Once restore is successful, remember to configure the backup to run instead.
You should configure backup to a different bucket and delete the old bucket.


## Networking port allocations

### Port Purposes

To keep the system more secure specific ports are allocated for specific purposes.

Here is the table of values
